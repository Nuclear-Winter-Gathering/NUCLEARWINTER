# NUCLEAR WINTER
"Nuclear Winter" is an annual event held between December 26th and 28th.
It began as a metal/alternative concert in 2021 and, over the years, has grown into a conceptual event that brings together many artists, people with critical thinking, a drive for progress, and goodwill â€” of all ages and social backgrounds.
It is a gathering where like-minded individuals meet to freely express themselves, inspire one another, and enjoy art.
